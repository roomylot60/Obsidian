# Shortform object
---

The Shortform object contains the video and various metadata that make up an individual shortform. You can use this object to create a preview screen composed of multiple thumbnails or to construct feeds for playing individual shortform. The Shortform search API or retrieval API can provide access to this object's information.

Please note that currently, only search and retrieval functionality for Shortforms are available via the API. However, in the near future, API support for creating, updating, and deleting Shortforms is also planned to be introduced. With the addition of these new functionalities, customers will be able to directly manage Shortforms through the API.
